# week2
- html and css
- connet them in github

# week 3: https://homeworktest2.herokuapp.com
- django template
- for loop

(p.s. This week we do about the for loop in both python and django templates.
I didnt do the random loop because I still dont know.
I still trying to figure out the relationship between python, django and html. 
Not sure how to communicate with them.
The homework isnt good because I still dont know how to use.)

# week4
- DATABASE
- SQLite and Postgresql
- Heroku cannot support SQLite
- Rake not found is normal

(p.s. when need to comfirm the homework can work or not, try to run it at server and then at heroku)
